# Commander

Commanders are standalone local or remote user interfaces for specified Sensors and Controllers in a particular HIOT deployment (e.g. a touch-panel in an open-plan office space to control lighting and heating, or a mobile app to control a smart apartment)

# Purpose

Commanders can integrate locally with a coordinator and do not need to connect with the platform (apart from initial set-up) - this allows them to work "offline", and with a pre-determined list of HIOT devices.
