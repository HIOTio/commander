# Commander

Commanders are standalone local or remote user interfaces for specified Sensors and Controllers in a particular HIOT deployment (e.g. a touch-panel in an open-plan office space to control lighting and heating, or a mobile app to control a smart apartment)

This is a very basic frontend for a commander. 

The underlying Commander functionality is implemented as a role in the <a href="https://www.github.com/HIOTio/device">Device repository</a>
